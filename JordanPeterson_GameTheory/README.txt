This project was inspired by a podcast episode featuring Joe Rogan and Jordan B. Peterson, where they discussed the concepts of equality and equity. Dr. Peterson argued that even when all factors are equal, certain individuals would still achieve greater success than others.

Motivated by the scientific method, I embarked on a mission to challenge this hypothesis. The following is a concise overview of the logical framework implemented in my study.

Assumption 1: A fair, two-sided coin toss grants each participant an equal 50% chance of winning. (using the numpy library to generate randomness)
Assumption 2: If participants gain units when they flip heads, but lose when other players flip heads, the outcomes should become progressively more evenly distributed as the number of iterations increases.

Results:
Surprisingly, my findings contradicted the anticipated outcome. Despite conducting hundreds of thousands or even millions of iterations, one player consistently lost all their units while another player disproportionately accumulated more units.
